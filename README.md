# Raspberry Pi Webcam Weather Classification

This project enables capturing webcam images, automatic archiving, fetching weather data from OpenWeatherMap, and classifying the weather situation.  
All results are saved as JSON files and additionally organized in a `classified` folder to prepare training data for Machine Learning.

## Features

### üì∏ Image Capture & Archiving
- Capture a webcam image via a shell script (`02_take_webcam_picture.sh`).
- Current image is stored in `jpg/current/IMG_4903.jpg`.
- All captures are archived into `jpg/old/<timestamp>.jpg`.

### üåÖ Daylight Gate (No Night Shots)
- New script `00_daylight_gate.sh` uses **sunwait** to calculate **civil dawn** and **civil dusk** based on your coordinates.
- `02_take_webcam_picture.sh` calls this gate before capturing an image.
- If it is **night** (before dawn or after dusk), the script exits with code `3` ‚Üí no image and no JSON are generated.
- Ensures that only **daylight captures** are taken, avoiding useless black night shots.

### üå¶Ô∏è Weather Data (OpenWeatherMap)
- New module `openweathermap.py` fetches current weather data based on the configuration (`config.local.json`).
- API key & city (`Laufamholz,de`) are loaded from the config file.
- Timeout handling: if the API does not respond, an error message is written into the JSON object.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Classification (Rule-based)
- New module `classify.py` creates a simple English classification from OWM data:
  - `clouds.all` ‚Üí cloud coverage (clear, few, scattered, broken, overcast)
  - `weather.id` ‚Üí phenomenon (rain, snow, thunderstorm, drizzle, fog, ‚Ä¶)
  - `wind.speed` ‚Üí if ‚â• 17 m/s, `(storm)` is added
- Output:
  - `classification`: compact string, e.g. `"overcast clouds with rain"`
  - `classification_detail`: structured details (`coverage`, `phenomenon`, `storm`, `wind_speed_ms`, `clouds_percent`, `weather_id`).

### üìÇ JSON Management
- For each image, a JSON file is generated and stored under `json/<timestamp>.json`.
- JSON contains:
  - Path to the archived image (`old_path`)
  - Weather data from OpenWeatherMap
  - Classification (string + structured details)
- Saved nicely formatted with `indent=4`.

### ü§ñ Classified Folder (for ML)
- JPG + JSON are additionally copied into  
  `jpg/classified/<classification>/`
- New subfolders are automatically created if not existing.
- Result: automatically organized training dataset (images + metadata).

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone or extract the project.  
2. Adjust configuration in `config.local.json` (OpenWeatherMap API key, upload settings).  
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
4. Install `sunwait` (required for daylight check):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install sunwait
   ```
5. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
